Ideas for actuarial projects:
(not actuarial) bone fracture identification from kaggle. This is already done. Just bring it to github.
   
For someone with 5 actuarial exams passed but no practical experience, engaging in projects that demonstrate both your technical knowledge and your ability to apply it to real-world scenarios can be highly beneficial. Here are some practical project ideas that can help showcase your skills to potential employers:

1. Risk Assessment for a Small Business:
Objective: Evaluate the risks associated with a small business in a specific sector (e.g., retail, tech startup).
Action: Gather data on various risk factors such as market fluctuations, operational risks, and insurance needs. Develop a risk model using tools like Excel or R to predict potential financial impacts and suggest mitigation strategies. This project can highlight your ability to analyze complex data sets and provide actionable insights.
2. Insurance Pricing Model:
Objective: Create a pricing model for a hypothetical insurance product (e.g., car insurance, health insurance).
Action: Use actuarial methods to assess risk factors, claim frequency, and severity. Develop a model that calculates premiums based on different customer profiles or scenarios. This can demonstrate your understanding of pricing strategies and actuarial software tools.
3. Pension Fund Analysis:
Objective: Analyze the sustainability of a small pension fund or a simulated one.
Action: Look at the fund's investment returns, demographic trends of its participants, and future obligations. Use actuarial techniques to forecast future liabilities and advise on investment strategy or contributions required to ensure solvency.
4. Life or Health Insurance Survival Analysis:
Objective: Investigate survival rates or health outcomes for a specific demographic or health condition.
Action: Use public datasets or simulated data to perform survival analysis with tools like R or Python. This could involve Kaplan-Meier estimates or Cox proportional hazards models. This project shows proficiency in statistical analysis and data interpretation.
5. Portfolio Optimization for Retirement:
Objective: Design an optimal investment portfolio for retirement planning.
Action: Apply modern portfolio theory or other financial models to balance risk vs. return for a hypothetical retiree, considering different economic scenarios. Use software like Python with libraries such as pandas or numpy to simulate and optimize different portfolio configurations.
6. Data Visualization of Actuarial Trends:
Objective: Present complex actuarial data in an understandable format for non-actuaries.
Action: Use tools like Tableau or Power BI to visualize trends in claim data, demographic shifts affecting insurance pricing, or market trends. This project can showcase your communication skills and your ability to make data-driven insights accessible.
7. Predictive Modeling for Claims:
Objective: Develop a model to predict claim occurrences or amounts.
Action: Use machine learning techniques on historical insurance claim data (or simulated data) to build predictive models. This could involve regression models, decision trees, or neural networks. Demonstrates advanced statistical and programming skills.
Execution Tips:
Accessibility: Use open-source tools where possible to ensure your work can be replicated by others.
Documentation: Keep detailed records of your methodology, data sources, and assumptions. This is crucial for validation by peers or employers.
Presentation: Prepare a report or a presentation summarizing your findings, methodologies, and conclusions. Highlight how this could benefit a company.
By working on these projects, you not only gain practical experience but also create a portfolio that can be showcased to potential employers, demonstrating your capability to handle real actuarial problems. Remember, the key is to show not just your technical prowess but also your problem-solving and communication skills.
